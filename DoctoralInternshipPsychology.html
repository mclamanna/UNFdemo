                            confidential and supportive environment where students&#39; concerns can be shared and
                            explored. Our hope is this internship will help you transition from a graduate student to

                            UNF is a public university located in Jacksonville, Florida. It initially opened admitting
                            only juniors, seniors, and graduate students in 1972, and started admitting freshman in
                            1984. Currently, the University has over 16,500 students enrolled, of which 3,500 live on
                            campus. UNF is home to 200 clubs and organizations as well as 26 fraternities and
                            sororities.<p></p>
                            The UNF Counseling Center is centrally located on campus in a building that was
                            completely remodeled in 2012. The Counseling Center staff was actively involved in
                            planning the layout of the newly expanded Center, which includes 21 counseling offices,
                            two small group rooms that share a one-way mirror, two medium-sized group rooms, a
                            conference room equipped with audio-visual equipment, a private waiting area, a
                            computer room where students complete 'paperwork', and additional space for our
                            executive staff, directors and psychiatric staff. We currently use the conference room on
                            a regular basis for training and have access to larger rooms/classrooms on campus if
                            needed. As a member of the State University System of Florida, all buildings, facilities,
                            and functions are compliant with the accessibility requirements of the ADA.<p></p>

                            Our mission is to provide quality training, necessary to facilitate the transitional process
                            from graduate student to an independently practicing psychologist. Our training Model is
                            the Practitioner-Scholar Model, which emphasizes service delivery based on the
                            integration of scientific principles, research, clinical judgment, and client values.
                            Training
                            is designed to provide a supervised and supportive learning environment in which
                            interns continue to develop and refine their skills and abilities in various competency
                            areas and gradually assume increased clinical responsibility. Interns are encouraged
                            and supported in cultivating their own professional style as they progress toward the
                            role of an autonomous psychologist.<p></p>

                                <li>To help interns refine their professional identity as a psychologist.</li>

                            Most UNF students come to the Counseling Center for individual counseling. Doctoral
                            interns will spend up to 13 hours per week doing individual therapy. The counseling
                            center has no specific session limits but the center strongly endorses a brief psychotherapy
                            model. Interns will have numerous opportunities to learn art therapy and
                            participate in an eating disorder team.

                            The Group Psychotherapy component is a major focus of training. Each intern is required to
                            co-facilitate one group in the fall and spring semester with a senior staff member. During
                            the summer semester, interns have an option to co-lead a group with another intern.
                            Interpersonal Process Groups are typical for the Counseling Center, but interns can, with
                            the permission of the Group Coordinator, run a theme specific or a psychoeducational group.
                            It is expected that by the end of the internship, interns will have at least 55 hours of
                            group psychotherapy direct contact hours.

                            in
                            crisis/emergency intervention skills and will be added to the regular rotation of on-call
                            counselors. During business hours, interns will have a dedicated time to see clients for
                            emergency appointments.
