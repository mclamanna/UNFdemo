                            We envision a UNF community where mental health and wellness are prioritized, and every

                            professionally, and personally. We are committed to recruiting and training people who
                            identify with and embody our core values. We offer a wide array of services that are easily
                            accessible, tailored, and well-known for our UNF community. Our ultimate goal is to empower
                            every student to cultivate resilience, self-awareness, and interpersonal skills, so they can
                            achieve their full potential both while they are at UNF and beyond.

                                        Master of Arts in Clinical Psychology from Marshal University. She considers
                                        herself a mental health generalist with personal and professional experience
                                        regarding a variety of cultures and subsets of people. She enjoys supporting and
                                        addressing relationship and family issues, as well as anxiety and depression.
                                        She believes that the stress of juggling the demands of life, anxiety,
                                        depression, and/or struggles in relationships, may improve with better insight
                                        and coping skills, which may be gained through the empowering process of
                                        personal counseling. In her clinical work, she draws upon the person-centered
                                        and cognitive behavioral theoretical models of counseling. Her clinical
                                        interests include exploring and further understanding the impact that physical,
                                        emotional, and spiritual well-being have on one another, with an emphasis on
                                        natural or alternative approaches to healing. In her free time, she enjoys
                                        playing tennis, restaurant outings with her husband and friends, exercising, and
                                        her children's extracurricular activities.</p>
