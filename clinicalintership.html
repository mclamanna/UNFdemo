                            The Counseling Center Practicum/Internship spans three semesters long (Fall, Spring, and
                            Summer). Interns are expected to commit to a minimum of 15 hours/week in the Fall
                            semester, followed by 20 hours/week in the Spring Semester and 20-25 hours/week in the
                            summer semester. This program of supervised clinical experience is designed to satisfy the
                            clinical requirements of a master’s degree in preparation for licensure as a Clinical Mental
                            Health Counselor in the State of Florida.<p></p>
                            Training at the Center allows for exposure to a broad range of clinical opportunities,
                            such as individual counseling, group counseling, outreach, and crisis intervention. That
                            exposure occurs under the guidance and support of our supervision team, which is
                            made up of a variety of supervisors who have years of experience and a commitment
                            to the professional development of our interns. Broadly speaking, our team at the
                            Center is multidisciplinary, consisting of mental health counselors, social workers, a
                            nutritionist, psychiatric nurse practitioners, a psychiatrist, psychologists, and support
                            staff. Additionally, interns work alongside other student clinicians in training, including
                            those completing their master’s degree in social work, their doctoral degree in Clinical
                            or Counseling Psychology, or their doctoral degree in Nursing. Our Center also trains
                            postgraduate and postdoctoral clinicians. Training within our multidisciplinary setting
                            allows interns to learn from other mental health professionals and prepares them to
                            work effectively in multidisciplinary environments after graduation.<p></p>
                            Our goal for every intern is that they truly become part of our staff! As their time allows,
                            interns are welcome to attend didactic presentations, staff meetings, case conferences, and
                            other Counseling Center activities. We look forward to creating relationships with each
                            intern and seeing how they decorate the office assigned to them!<p></p>

                            the start of the internship. Currently, our center has affiliation agreements with the
                            University of North Florida, Jacksonville University, and Nova Southeastern University.

                                occur in the evening or on weekends. Outreach opportunities, especially those that occur
                                outside of operating hours, are not required, but interns are encouraged to participate
