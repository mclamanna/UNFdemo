                    The UNF Counseling Center provides psychiatric consultation and medication
                    management to students whose presenting issues suggest that evaluation by a
                    psychiatric professional would be appropriate or helpful. When psychiatrically indicated,
                    a student may be given a prescription for medication to treat their clinical symptoms
                    (e.g., depression, anxiety). Often, students are encouraged to participate in counseling
                    in addition to taking medication.
                    <p></p>
                    <h5>Availability of Psychiatric Services</h5>
                    <p></p>
                    Group counseling is a powerful and effectual way for students to share, give and
                    receive support, as well as to learn and heal. Many students can benefit from
                    counseling in a group format and all the information shared remains confidential.
                    Therapy groups are free and open to all currently enrolled UNF students.<p></p>
                    Group works! In studies comparing group psychotherapy to individual counseling,
                    group therapy has been shown to be as effective and sometimes even more effective
                    than individual counseling.<p></p>
                    Group therapy offers the opportunity for students to learn new skills, to share
                    concerns as well as inherent wisdom in a facilitated environment with other students.
                    Some groups are focused on common concerns, such as anxiety, relationships, and
                    self-understanding while other groups offer an opportunity for students with a shared
                    identity to gather and connect in community.
                    <p></p>
                    <h5>How Do I Join a Group?</h5>
                    <p></p>
                    Not all of our groups require an initial assessment prior to participation, and some are
                    open/drop-in groups, meaning you are welcome to join even if you are not an
                    established client of the center.<p></p>
                    If you are not already a client of our center and want to participate in a group that
                    requires an initial assessment, you are invited to contact the center to schedule an
                    appointment. During this appointment, you will have an opportunity to talk with a
                    counselor about your immediate concerns and interest in group therapy. This

                    appointment will provide you an opportunity to learn more about the various groups
                    that are offered and to determine if the group format would be a good match for you!
                    <p></p>
